**How:**

- Use the verb table in your file (funfun-korean-verb.md) to review verbs from Lessons 1 to 7.
- Write each verb in Hangul, Romanization, and English meaning on flashcards.
- Practice conjugating each verb in past, present, and future tenses.

**Example Exercise:**

Write sentences for each verb in all three tenses: 가다 (to go):

- Past: 어제 학교에 갔어요. (I went to school yesterday.)
- Present: 지금 학교에 가요. (I am going to school now.)
- Future: 내일 학교에 갈 거예요. (I will go to school tomorrow.)

# Focus on Grammar

**Why:** Grammar helps you structure sentences and express ideas clearly.

**How:**

- Review the grammar points from each lesson (see the summary provided earlier).

**Example Practice:**

Lesson 4: -은/ㄴ 후에 (After doing something):

- Structure: Verb stem + -은/ㄴ 후에
- Example: 책을 읽은 후에 숙제를 해요. (After reading a book, I do homework.)
- Your Turn: Write 3 sentences using this grammar.

# Practice Listening and Speaking

**Why:** Listening and speaking are essential for real-life communication.

**How:**

- Use audio resources or apps like Duolingo, TalkToMeInKorean, or FunFun Korean audio files.

**Example Practice:**

Listen to a sentence like: "밥 먹기 전에 손을 씻어요." (I wash my hands before eating.)

- Repeat it aloud and try to create a similar sentence: "자기 전에 책을 읽어요." (I read a book before sleeping.)

# Write and Translate

**Why:** Writing helps reinforce grammar and vocabulary.

**How:**

- Write a short diary entry every day using the grammar and vocabulary you've learned.

- 아침을 먹은 후에 학교에 가요. (After eating breakfast, I go to school.)

# Practice Dialogues

**Why:** Dialogues help you practice real-life conversations.
